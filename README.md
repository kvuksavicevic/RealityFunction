# 🌌 Reality Formula: R(t) Interactive Simulation

## ✨ Overview
This interactive web application visualizes a speculative model of consciousness-influenced reality, expressed through the formula:

**R(t) = √[(mc²)² + (hI(t))²] × α × W(t) × Φ(t) × MI(I, C)**

The simulation demonstrates how **matter, information, and consciousness** dynamically interact over a 24-hour cycle to shape perceived reality.

## 🔬 The Formula Explained
- **R(t)**: *Reality Richness* – The manifested quality of experienced reality at time *t*.
- **E_R(t) = √[(mc²)² + (hI(t))²]**: The "Energy of Reality," combining mass-energy (mc²) with informational energy (hI(t)).
- **Φ(t)**: *Integrated Information* – A measure of consciousness quality (inspired by Integrated Information Theory).
- **W(t)**: *Free Will Parameter* – The degree of conscious agency (0 to 1).
- **MI(I, C)**: *Mutual Information* – The alignment between internal experience (I) and external reality (C).

## 🎮 How to Use the Simulation
1.  Click the **"Pokreni simulaciju stvarnosti"** (Run Reality Simulation) button.
2.  Watch as the simulation generates a 24-hour visualization of a conscious agent's mental states.
3.  Observe six interrelated graphs showing the dynamic changes in information, consciousness, free will, and their combined effect on reality richness.
4.  Review the correlation matrix to see which factors most strongly influence the experience of reality.

## 📊 What the Simulation Shows
The model cycles through key mental states:
- **Deep Sleep (2–5 AM)**: Minimal consciousness, low reality richness.
- **REM Sleep (5–7 AM)**: Dreaming state with moderate consciousness.
- **Focused Work (10 AM)**: High information processing and alignment.
- **Meditation (3 PM)**: Peak integration, free will, and reality richness.

A core insight of the model is that **consciousness quality (Φ) and free will (W) have the highest correlation with reality richness (R)**, suggesting that how we integrate experience and exercise agency profoundly shapes our reality.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation
This is a client-side web application built with:
- **Pyodide**: Runs Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) directly in the browser via WebAssembly.
- **HTML5 / JavaScript**: Handles the UI and execution trigger.
- **Matplotlib**: Generates all visualizations dynamically.

The simulation runs entirely in your browser—no data is sent to any server.

## 🧠 Philosophical & Scientific Context
This model is a **thought experiment and conceptual tool**, not an established physical theory. It draws inspiration from:
- **Physics**: Mass-energy equivalence, informational physics.
- **Neuroscience**: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness.
- **Philosophy**: Models of mental causation and participatory reality.

It serves as a bridge between quantitative science and qualitative experience, formalizing the intuition that reality is co-created by observation, information, and conscious agency.
